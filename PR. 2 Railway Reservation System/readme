# 🚆 Railway Reservation System (C++)

## 📖 Introduction
The **Railway Reservation System** is a console-based application developed in **C++** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
This project allows users to manage train records efficiently by providing options to **add**, **display**, and **search** train details using a **menu-driven system**.

This project is developed as part of **Project–2** assigned by **Red & White Multimedia Education**.
